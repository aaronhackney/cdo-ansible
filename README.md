# CDO and Ansible

This is an assortment of roles, scripts, sample inventory, and playbooks for interacting with Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO). These examples use the Ansible playbook model where we define CDO tenants' and managed devices' settings using inventory files, group_vars and host_vars files.

The purpose of this compilationis to  illustrate ways that Ansible can be used to manage a number of devices and tenants in Cisco Defense Orchestrator.

See the README files in each of the various locations in the project for details.
